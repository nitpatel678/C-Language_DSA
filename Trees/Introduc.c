/*
Binary tree is a tree which has two children nodes for all its
nodes.
n = nodes then edges = n-1 

degree = no of direct children
binary tree is tree of degrre two

node can have 0,1,2 children


TREES ARE IDEAL FOR representating hierarchical data 

Types OF Binary Tree-
1. Full or strict binary tree - 0 or 2 children
2. Perfect binary tree - all internal nodes have 2 children and are on same level 
3. Complete binary tree - all level are fill except possibly the last level and last level must left align
4. Degenerate tree - parent node has only one child
5. left/right skewed tree
